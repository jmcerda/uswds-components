description: 'Hero paragraphs are used at the top of a landing page to help set the tone for the content of your site and to help users understand what your brand is all about. The Hero paragraph offers a callout which provides a high-level overview of the content on the site and will often reference the Hero image that sits behind it. <em>See <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/templates/landing-page/">U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)</a> for more information.</em>'
